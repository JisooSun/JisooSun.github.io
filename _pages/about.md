Hello!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt University. I am working with [Dr. Isabel Gauthier](http://gauthier.psy.vanderbilt.edu/) in the Object Perception Lab, investigating how people categorize, recognize, and represent objects in various domains.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Master’s degree in Cognitive Science from Yonsei University in South Korea. While there, I worked with [Dr. Sang Chul Chong](ttps://vcc.yonsei.ac.kr/).
