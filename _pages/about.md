Hello!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt University. I am working with <a href="http://gauthier.psy.vanderbilt.edu/ target="_blank">Dr. Isabel Gauthier</a> in the Object Perception Lab,  investigating how people categorize, recognize, and represent objects in various domains.


======
I received my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Master’s degree in Cognitive Science from Yonsei University in South Korea. While there, I worked with <a href="https://vcc.yonsei.ac.kr/ target="_blank">Dr. Sang Chul Chong</a>.
