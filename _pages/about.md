Hello!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt University. I am working with Dr. Isabel Gauthier in the [Object Perception Lab](http://gauthier.psy.vanderbilt.edu/), investigating how people categorize, recognize, and represent objects in various domains.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Master’s degree in Cognitive Science from Yonsei University in South Korea. While there, I worked with Dr. Sang Chul Chong in the [Vision, Cognition, and Consciousness Lab](https://vcc.yonsei.ac.kr/).
